## üîÅ **I. Rebasing Tokens**

**Definition:** Tokens that **automatically adjust their total supply** (increase or decrease) to maintain a **target price** or **peg**.

**üîß How It Works:**

* Instead of changing the token **price**, the protocol changes the **number of tokens** in your wallet.
* The value of your holdings stays the same, but the number of tokens increases or decreases.
* Common in **elastic supply tokens** like **Ampleforth (AMPL)**.

**üîÑ Example:**

* You hold **100 AMPL**.
* If the price of AMPL is above the target (say \$1.05), the protocol **rebases** by increasing supply: now you have **110 AMPL** (but each is worth slightly less).
* If it's below \$1.00, you might end up with **90 AMPL**.

***üß† Use Case:***

* Trying to create a **stablecoin** or **price-targeting token** without using collateral or reserves.

## üìà **II. Inflationary Tokens**

**Definition:** Tokens that **increase in total supply** over time, usually through mechanisms like **staking rewards**, **mining**, or **yield farming**.

### üîß How It Works:

* New tokens are constantly minted and distributed.
* Token supply grows over time, causing **inflation**.
* Often used to **incentivize participation** (e.g., securing a network, providing liquidity).

### üîÑ Example:

* Ethereum (pre-merge) was inflationary: new ETH was issued to miners.
* Many DeFi protocols (like **Aave**, **Sushi**) have inflationary models for governance token rewards.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk:

* If demand doesn‚Äôt keep up with supply growth, token price can go down.

## üìâ **III. Deflationary Tokens**

**Definition:** Tokens that **decrease in total supply** over time, usually by **burning tokens**.

### üîß How It Works:

* A portion of tokens is permanently destroyed (burned) on every transfer or periodically.
* This reduces circulating supply, aiming to make tokens more scarce (and potentially more valuable).

### üîÑ Example:

* **Shiba Inu (SHIB)** and **Safemoon** burn tokens on each transaction.
* Some protocols use **buy-and-burn** mechanisms (e.g., Uniswap fee burning).

### ‚úÖ Use Case:

* Encouraging long-term holding by simulating scarcity.

## üí∏ **IV. Tokens with Fee-on-Transfer**

**Definition:** Tokens that **charge a fee** every time they are transferred.

**üîß How It Works:**

* A percentage (e.g., 1% to 10%) of the transferred amount is taken as a **fee**.
* Fee can be:

  * **Burned** (reducing supply),
  * **Redistributed** to holders (reflections),
  * **Sent to a treasury** or liquidity pool.

**üîÑ Example:**

* **Safemoon**: 10% fee ‚Äî 5% goes to holders, 5% to liquidity.
* **Reflect.finance (RFI)** uses **reflections**: rewards distributed to holders without staking.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Consideration:**

* Can break some DeFi protocols or DEXs that assume transfer amounts equal expected amounts (e.g., `transferFrom()` fails due to reduced amount).
